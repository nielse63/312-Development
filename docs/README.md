# 312 Development

> *"I think it's important to have some documentation of the past."

> **–- Henry Rollins**

The purpose for creating such comprehensive documentation for my personal website is two fold:

1. To ensure the processes, tools, and technologies I’m using here can be used again in a meaningful and replicable way
2. To re-evaluate my own thought processes during development, and put into teachable language the work I’ve done.
