# Guiding Principles

I try to maintain a few simple, easy-to-hit guiding principles to ensure that I'm producing the highest quality app that I can.

This really boils down to a few areas I focus on:

## Focus on the user

Never put your wants or needs over the user.

## Everything is a learning experience

Don't be too hard on yourself - but don't suddenly think you're the shit. Keep your head down and keep grinding.

## Keep it as simple as possible

Any software engineer can hit a deadline or create an app - to do so while keeping the code simple and elegant shows true growth, maturity, and experience.

## 90% planning / 10% coding

Despite the fact that I get excited to jump into my work, I recognize that I need to spend more time planning and thinking than executing. It goes back to the "measure twice, cut once" rule.
