# Motivation & Goals

I try to rebuild my portfolio website at least once a year to stay current with engineering and design trends, as well as to showcase my latest work, experiences, etc. Because this is my personal website I have a little more liberty to do what I want, without a hard deadline. As a result, my primary goal is to create a unique experience, utilizing the latest technology and\ trends, while delivery a performant, secure, and accessible app.

With this latest redesign effort, I knew I wanted to showcase that I&#x27;m more _engineer_ than _developer_, and also wanted to showcase a more personal side on my [About Me](https://312development.com/#/about-me) page. I kept the GitHub and npmjs.org stats from the last iteration because I feel it accurately conveys involvement in open-source projects and demonstrates my knowledge of the skills I claim to have.

If my intentions aren&#x27;t being conveyed, or you find a bug or issue on my site, please [create a new issue](https://github.com/nielse63/312-Development/issues/new) in the repo. Or even better, if you know how to fix the bug, [create a PR](https://github.com/nielse63/312-Development/compare) against the master branch. If you don&#x27;t want to do my work for me, shoot me an email or tweet (see below).

Anyway, thanks for checking out my portfolio!
